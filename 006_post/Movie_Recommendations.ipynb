    "As someone who loves rewatching movies or finding movies similar to ones I have seen before and loved, I wanted to see how chat gpt could cater movie recommendations based on knowing my specific music taste and what movies I liked before and why. For example, I don't particularly love certain kinds of horror movies, but do enjoy psychological thrillers - like the movie Se7en but not unlike the movie Sinister. I will be using this example to see the movies Chat GPT gives me and why based on information. There are some movies I have seen and similarly liked and want to see if given this information they will be included in the suggested watch list I am asking for."

    "I am interested in finding new movies to watch. I only like some horror movies, specifically the ones that are more so psychological thrillers and not paranormal jump scare based movies. for example, I loved the movie Se7en but did not like the movie Sinister. Can you help me find more psychological thrillers / horror movies based on this information?"
