    "text": "Introduction\nAs someone who loves rewatching movies or finding movies similar to ones I have seen before and loved, I wanted to see how chat gpt could cater movie recommendations based on knowing my specific music taste and what movies I liked before and why. For example, I don’t particularly love certain kinds of horror movies, but do enjoy psychological thrillers - like the movie Se7en but not unlike the movie Sinister. I will be using this example to see the movies Chat GPT gives me and why based on information. There are some movies I have seen and similarly liked and want to see if given this information they will be included in the suggested watch list I am asking for.\nPrompt\nI am interested in finding new movies to watch. I only like some horror movies, specifically the ones that are more so psychological thrillers and not paranormal jump scare based movies. for example, I loved the movie Se7en but did not like the movie Sinister. Can you help me find more psychological thrillers / horror movies based on this information?\nChat GPT Response\nAbsolutely! Since you liked Se7en (a slow-burn psychological thriller with dark, grounded crime elements) and disliked Sinister (a paranormal jump-scare horror), it sounds like you prefer:\nPsychological tension over supernatural scares\nRealistic human villains over ghosts/demons\nAtmospheric dread and mind games over loud startles or gore\nHere’s a list of movies that align with those preferences:\n🧠 Psychological Thrillers (Dark, Suspenseful, Grounded)\nZodiac (2007) — From the same director as Se7en. A slow, unsettling hunt for the Zodiac Killer with a creeping sense of obsession and paranoia.\nPrisoners (2013) — A tense, morally complex thriller about two missing girls and the desperate hunt to find them.\nGone Girl (2014) — A sharp psychological mystery about a missing wife and the media circus that follows.\nNightcrawler (2014) — An unsettling character study about a morally void crime journalist chasing shocking footage.\nThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) — A dark, stylish investigation of a decades-old murder with twisted family secrets.\n🪞 Psychological Horror (Mind Games, Disturbing, Not Paranormal)\nBlack Swan (2010) — A descent into obsession and psychosis set in the world of ballet; deeply unsettling and surreal.\nThe Babadook (2014) — Although it has a “monster,” it’s really a metaphor for grief and depression; psychological more than paranormal.\nThe Others (2001) — Minimal jump scares, mostly eerie atmosphere and psychological tension.\nThe Machinist (2004) — A haunting portrayal of insomnia and guilt driving a man to the edge of sanity.\nJacob’s Ladder (1990) — Disorienting and disturbing exploration of trauma and reality distortion.\n🩸 Crime Thrillers with Psychological Depth\nSilence of the Lambs (1991) — A psychological cat-and-mouse between an FBI trainee and a brilliant but terrifying killer.\nNo Country for Old Men (2007) — A tense and philosophical thriller about fate, morality, and a relentless killer.\nMystic River (2003) — A dark, brooding drama about childhood trauma and its repercussions in adulthood.\nAdditional Prompt\nFor more information, a movie I liked as much as Se7en was Shutter Island, please give me another list based on that additional information\nChat GPT Response\nAbsolutely! Since you liked Se7en (a slow-burn psychological thriller with dark, grounded crime elements) and disliked Sinister (a paranormal jump-scare horror), it sounds like you prefer:\nPsychological tension over supernatural scares\nRealistic human villains over ghosts/demons\nAtmospheric dread and mind games over loud startles or gore\nHere’s a list of movies that align with those preferences:\n🧠 Psychological Thrillers (Dark, Suspenseful, Grounded)\nZodiac (2007) — From the same director as Se7en.

(Less “scary” than Sinister; much more psychological.)\nThe Prestige (2006) — Two rival magicians in a dark, twisting battle of obsession and deception. Brilliant and suspenseful.\nFight Club (1999) — From the same director as Se7en; explores identity, madness, and self-destruction with a major twist.\nMemento (2000) — A disorienting thriller told in reverse about a man with short-term memory loss trying to solve a murder.\nOldboy (2003) — A dark, gripping Korean thriller about vengeance, imprisonment, and shocking secrets.\n🕵️‍♀️ Dark Mystery / Detective Thrillers\nGone Girl (2014) — A missing person case spirals into a psychological battle of manipulation and deceit.\nZodiac (2007) — Slow-burning and obsessive; follows journalists and police chasing the elusive Zodiac Killer.\nPrisoners (2013) — A gripping and disturbing thriller about a desperate father hunting for his missing daughter.\nThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) — Dark, icy tone and a deeply layered murder mystery investigation.\n🪞 Psychological Descent into Madness\nBlack Swan (2010) — A haunting portrait of obsession, perfectionism, and mental unraveling.\nThe Machinist (2004) — Stark and unsettling; follows a man consumed by guilt and insomnia until he loses his grip on reality.\nEnemy (2013) — Surreal and disturbing, about a man who discovers an exact double of himself; very Shutter Island-like in tone.\nConclusion\nAfter looking through the responses (and having seen many of the ones listed and liking them) so overall do feel like AI did a good job capturing the essence of what I liked about the certain films I listed. I have not watched all of them, so will be later watching the ones I have not seen yet and continue to review and return."

    "text": "Introduction\nI am hosting a dinner party tonight and would like to see if Chat GPT can help me come up with a good cocktail that is unique and tasty to serve for a big group.\nPrompt\nI am hosting a dinner party tonight for around 20 people. It is a calm dinner with friends of mine and I want to think of a good cocktail that is universal enough to serve for a large group of people that most likely everyone will enjoy - not overwhelmingly sweet or bitter, but a classic cocktail. I do not want a standard cocktail like a margarita but something unique. Can you help me come up with something?\nResponse\n🥂 Option 1 — French 75 Punch\nProfile: Light, crisp, bubbly, citrusy — a celebratory crowd-pleaser Why it works: Universally appealing, refreshing, and festive without being sugary\nIngredients (for ~20 servings):\n2 cups gin (London Dry like Tanqueray or Beefeater)\n1½ cups fresh lemon juice\n1½ cups simple syrup (1:1 sugar and water)\n2 bottles chilled dry sparkling wine (like brut Champagne or cava)\nLemon wheels and sprigs of thyme for garnish\nInstructions:\nChill all ingredients.\nIn a punch bowl, mix gin, lemon juice, and simple syrup with ice.\nJust before serving, top with sparkling wine.\nGarnish with lemon wheels and thyme.\nPro tip: Serve in coupe or flute glasses. Very elegant and easy to make ahead.\n🍊 Option 2 — White Negroni Spritz\nProfile: Bright, aromatic, slightly herbal — more interesting than a standard spritz Why it works: Sophisticated but not bitter like a classic Negroni\nIngredients (for ~20 servings):\n2 cups gin\n2 cups Lillet Blanc (or Cocchi Americano)\n1½ cups Suze (gentian liqueur — lightly bitter)\n2 bottles prosecco or sparkling water (depending on strength preference)\nOrange slices for garnish\nInstructions:\nMix gin, Lillet, and Suze with ice in a pitcher or punch bowl.\nChill thoroughly.\nJust before serving, top with prosecco (for a boozy spritz) or sparkling water (for lower-ABV).\nGarnish with orange slices.\nPro tip: This looks beautiful served over ice in large wine glasses.\n🍑 Option 3 — Peach Bourbon Smash (Lightened)\nProfile: Fruity yet balanced, slightly herbal — crowd-pleaser for whiskey skeptics Why it works: Approachable and unexpected; feels seasonal and cozy\nIngredients (for ~20 servings):\n3 cups bourbon\n2 cups peach purée or nectar\n1 cup fresh lemon juice\n1 cup simple syrup\nHandful of fresh mint leaves\nClub soda (about 3–4 cups) to top\nInstructions:\nMuddle mint lightly in a punch bowl.\nAdd bourbon, peach, lemon juice, and simple syrup.\nStir with ice and chill.\nTop with soda just before serving.\nGarnish with mint sprigs and peach slices.\nPro tip: If peach isn’t in season, frozen slices or high-quality nectar work great.\nConclusion\nI ended up making and trying each of these drinks with a few of my friends prior to the party, and ended up serving the French 75 and White Negroni spritz. These were well balanced drinks and great for a dinner party - and definitely much better than something I would have come up with!"
