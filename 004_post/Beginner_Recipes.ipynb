    "Got it ‚Äî you want to build out a little rotation of staple dinners: not just chicken and pasta, but a handful of easy-to-repeat recipes that are flavorful, not intimidating, and versatile enough to become go-tos. I‚Äôll break this down into categories with examples you can pick from.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Proteins Beyond Chicken\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Vegetable Curry\n",

    "\n",
    "3. One-Pot or Sheet Pan Dinners\n",
    "\n",
    "Shrimp Fried Rice\n",
    "Use leftover rice, scramble in an egg, toss in shrimp, frozen peas, soy sauce, and sesame oil.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sausage & Veggie Sheet Pan Bake\n",

    "\n",
    "Risotto (Easy Style)\n",

    "5. ‚ÄúUpgrade Your Pasta‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "Since you‚Äôre already doing chicken + pasta, here are a few twists:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cacio e Pepe (buttery, peppery cheese pasta‚Äî3 ingredients, feels fancy).\n",
    "\n",
    "Bolognese (ground beef/turkey slow cooked with tomato and onion).\n",
    "\n",
    "Pasta Primavera (lots of saut√©ed seasonal veggies, olive oil, garlic, parmesan).\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ Here‚Äôs a tip: pick 5 recipes across these categories and put them on rotation for the next month. Once they feel easy, swap in new ones so you always have variety without needing to think too hard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like me to make you a sample 1-week dinner plan with shopping list (based on these staples), so it‚Äôs plug-and-play?"
