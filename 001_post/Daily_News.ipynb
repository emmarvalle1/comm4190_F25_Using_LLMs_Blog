    "I am trying to be better at being up to date with current world news, but sometimes I do not have time to check every app that I frequently check every morning or throughout the day. The news outlets I typically check and have downloaded on my phone are The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, BBC News and The Guardian. I also like to check the Middle Eastern sections of these sources (where applicable) to stay informed on the relevant dynamics and events occuring in the Middle East. I am going to tell Chat GPT this information and see if they can give me a good daily overview/summary to gather key points that I would have found in those news outlets."
