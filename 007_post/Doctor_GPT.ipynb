    "I followed steps, recipes, and instructions like these throughout the week, solely using Chat GPT's consultation to direct my actions, and definitely saw a result. Everything it advised me was correct and my stomach bug slowly subsided as I had Chat GPT help me reintroduce \"normal\" foods back into my diet. I find Chat GPT very helpful and an incredible resources for illnesses that aren't severe or remotely health threatening. Especially when I have constant small follow up questions that aren't necessary to consult with a doctor to ask, AI can be incredibly useful and I had a great experience, as I usually do when consulting GPT over health related issues."
