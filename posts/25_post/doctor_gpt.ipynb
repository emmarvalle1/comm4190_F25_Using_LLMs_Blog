    "\n",
    "As someone who sometimes convinces themselves they are sicker than they actually are, I decided to use different LLMs as a sanity check before going to the doctor to do a strep test. I realized that although LLMs are of course not a doctor and cannot provide verified medical advice, I wanted to check if it was useful to help me decide if it was necessary for me to go through the trouble of getting a strep test. I inputted my symptoms and saw if Chat GPT could gauge if my symptoms seemed strep-related. I then cross checked with our LLMs to see if I received the same answer."

    "If your sore throat has significantly improved by Day 3 with only supportive care (Tylenol, rest, tea, etc.), it becomes much less likely that you have strep throat. Here’s why:\n",
    "\n",
    "How strep throat usually behaves\n",
    "\n",
    "Symptoms are sudden and severe: very painful throat, fever, swollen lymph nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It typically does NOT improve noticeably within 2–3 days without antibiotics.\n",
    "\n",
    "People usually feel as bad or worse on day 2–3, not substantially better.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re already improving\n",
    "\n",
    "When symptoms start resolving that quickly, the cause is usually:\n",
    "\n",
    "A viral infection (the most common cause)\n",
    "\n",
    "Irritation from dryness, allergies, or another benign cause\n",
    "\n",
    "Strep throat almost never gets substantially better on its own that fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "Should you still test?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the simple breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "You should test for strep if:\n",
    "\n",
    "You still have significant symptoms (fever, swollen lymph nodes, difficulty swallowing, white patches)\n",
    "\n",
    "The throat pain returns or worsens\n",

    "Based on your symptoms and fast improvement, you do not need to test for strep.\n",

    "Since your symptoms have substantially improved by day 3, you're likely dealing with a viral throat infection rather than strep throat. Viral sore throats typically improve on their own within 2-3 days, which matches your timeline perfectly.\n",
    "Strep throat usually doesn't get significantly better without antibiotics - it tends to persist or even worsen over several days. The fact that you're feeling substantially better with just supportive care (Tylenol, soup, tea) is a good sign it's probably viral.\n",
    "That said, you could still get tested if:\n",
    "\n",
    "You want peace of mind\n",
    "You're around young children or immunocompromised people (strep is contagious)\n",
    "You develop new symptoms like fever, or the sore throat returns\n",
    "Your symptoms weren't quite as improved as you thought\n",
    "\n",
    "But honestly, if you're continuing to feel better, most people in your situation would just continue monitoring and skip the test. The main benefit of testing at this point would be knowing for sure whether you had strep, which could inform future decisions if similar symptoms come back.\n",
    "Keep an eye on your symptoms over the next day or two. If they rebound or you develop a fever, then definitely get tested. Otherwise, sounds like your body handled this one on its own.Claude is AI and can make mistakes. Please double-check responses. Sonnet 4.5"

    "Since your severe sore throat subsided quickly with home remedies, it was likely a viral infection (like a cold or flu) rather than strep throat, which often lingers or worsens without antibiotics; however, because untreated strep can lead to serious issues like rheumatic fever, if you still have doubts, see a doctor for a strep test, especially if you notice white spots, fever, or a rash, but don't worry too much since your rapid improvement points away from strep. \n",
    "Why it was likely viral:\n",
    "Quick Resolution: Viral sore throats often improve within a few days, just like yours did.\n",
    "Home Remedies: Tylenol, soup, and tea are great for viruses, not specific to strep.\n",
    "Strep's Nature: Strep throat (bacterial) usually needs antibiotics to fully resolve and prevent complications, and symptoms might persist or worsen. \n",
    "When to consider testing (if symptoms return or you're worried):\n",
    "White spots on your tonsils.\n",
    "Fever (especially high).\n",
    "Rash on your skin (scarlet fever).\n",
    "Swollen lymph nodes in your neck.\n",
    "Severe pain when swallowing. \n",
    "Key Takeaway: Your speedy recovery is a good sign! Most sore throats are viral and resolve on their own, but a strep test (rapid or culture) can confirm if you're still concerned about complications. "

    "Overall, I received very consistent advice throughout the different LLMs, besides the fact that Google AI was the least thorough. However, it was definitely helpful and eased my worries regarding a need to get a strep test. In the past, Chat GPT has been helpful with my minor illnesses and given me great advice, especially in this instance, as I in fact did not have strep."
