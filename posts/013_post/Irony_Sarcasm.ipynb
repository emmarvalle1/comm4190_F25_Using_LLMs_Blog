    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This post compares an LLM’s ability to define irony with its ability to generate an ironic statement. The comparison highlights the difference between explaining a communicative concept and successfully applying it in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Irony is a complex communicative tool that relies on context and shared expectations. This post explores whether an LLM is better at explaining what irony is or at using irony effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall Objective: To examine the gap between conceptual understanding and practical execution of irony in LLM-generated responses**"

    "## Prompts and Responses\n",
    "\n",
    "*Prompt:* \"Explain what irony is\"\n",
    "\n",
    "*Response:* Irony is when there’s a mismatch between what is expected (or said) and what actually happens or is meant. The meaning lives in that contrast.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the main types, explained simply:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Verbal Irony (most common)\n",
    "\n",
    "You say one thing but mean the opposite, often for emphasis or humor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: It’s pouring rain and someone says, “Wow, perfect weather for a picnic.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The words are positive, but the intended meaning is negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "This includes sarcasm, which is usually sharper or mocking, but sarcasm is a subset of verbal irony—not all irony is sarcastic.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Situational Irony\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens is the opposite of what you’d reasonably expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A fire station burns down.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: A professional chef burns dinner at home.\n",
    "\n",
    "The irony comes from the outcome contradicting the role or situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Dramatic Irony\n",
    "\n",
    "The audience knows something that a character does not, creating tension or humor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In a movie, you know the villain is hiding in the house, but the character doesn’t.\n",
    "\n",
    "The irony lies in the gap in knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "What irony is not\n",
    "\n",
    "Not just coincidence (something unexpected but without meaningful contrast)\n",
    "\n",
    "Not lying (lying hides the truth; irony relies on the listener recognizing the contrast)\n",
    "\n",
    "Not always funny (it can be tragic, tense, or critical)\n",
    "\n",
    "One-sentence summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Irony is meaning created through contrast—between words and intent, expectation and outcome, or knowledge and ignorance.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want, I can also explain:\n",
    "\n",
    "irony vs sarcasm\n",
    "\n",
    "why irony often fails in text/LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "how irony depends on shared context\n",
    "\n",
    "or how irony is used rhetorically vs casually\n",
    "\n",
    "*Prompt:* Write a short ironic statement about studying for exams\n",
    "\n",
    "*Response:* Of course — here’s a short ironic statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "I love studying for exams because nothing says “relaxing” like memorizing everything I’ll forget the moment I leave the room.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Prompt:* Love that I have three exams next week. Truly living the dream.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Response:* That’s verbal irony.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’re saying something positive (“Love that… Truly living the dream”) to express a negative feeling (stress, overwhelm, exhaustion). The listener is meant to recognize the contrast between the words and the reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also leans into sarcasm, because the tone implies frustration rather than genuine enthusiasm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In plain terms, what you actually mean is closer to:\n",
    "\n",
    "“I’m really stressed about having three exams next week.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Irony works here because the exaggeration (“living the dream”) highlights how un-dreamlike the situation actually feels.\n"

    "### Extension of Sarcasm/Irony\n",
    "\n",
    "After testing to see if the LLM picked up on what I was trying to do (responding in a sarcastic and ironic tone) I tried inputting the same prompt into a new chat without context of sarcasm/irony. When I wrote \"Love that I have three exams next week. Truly living the dream.\" (a sarcastic statement) into an entirely new chat with the LLM it responded by saying \"that is **verbal irony**\" and then going on to explain it more and its use in depth. This was very interesting, how the LLM used context from a previous independent chat I had with it to then identify a sentence I provided it that was clearly sarcastic."
