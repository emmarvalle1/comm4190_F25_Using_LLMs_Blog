    "### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "This post examines how LLMs respond to vague or underspecified prompts. Rather than requesting clarification, the model often generates confident explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**\n",
    "This post tests the model’s tolerance for ambiguity and its tendency to prioritize fluency over uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prompt\n",
    "Since LLM's are known to function almost entirely off of the context they are given (opposed to scouring the web for information and information they obtain), so I wanted to see how GPT acts with limited or confusing context. I inputted the prompt: \"Explain why this is happening\" and kept prompting it to answer when it asked for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflection\n",
    "Over repeated efforts, GPT clearly is unable to move forward without necessary context. I have seen this happen before in an actual instance where I did not provide enough information, and in a test case scenario proves that right.\n",
