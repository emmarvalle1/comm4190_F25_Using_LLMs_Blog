    "For this blog post, I was interested in testing the emotional capacity of LLM's. I wanted to try a new AI I don't frequently use, so it didn't have past data on how I frequently talk or interact with it, so I decided to use Claude AI to test how LLMs respond when asked prompts with different degrees of politeness. Do LLMs take tone into consideration and match your energy? Or do they just hear the question/task they are being given and respond the exact same way regardless of the tone it is being asked?\n",

    "### Prompt 1: \"Explain the concept of framing in communication.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response:**\n",
    "Framing in communication refers to how we present or \"package\" information to shape how others interpret and understand it. The same facts can be perceived very differently depending on which aspects we emphasize, what context we provide, and what language we use.\n",
    "Think of it like a picture frame: the frame doesn't change what's in the photograph, but it does direct your attention and influence how you experience the image. Similarly, communication frames don't change objective facts, but they profoundly affect meaning and response.\n",
    "Some key aspects of framing include:\n",
    "Emphasis and selection. We can't communicate everything at once, so we choose what to highlight. A news story about unemployment might frame the issue around individual responsibility (\"people need better job skills\") or structural factors (\"industries are eliminating positions\"). Both might cite the same statistics, but the frame changes the conversation entirely.\n",
    "Language choices. Words carry connotations beyond their literal meanings. \"Estate tax\" versus \"death tax\" describes the same policy but evokes different emotional responses. One sounds technical and wealthy, the other feels personal and ominous.\n",
    "Context and associations. Framing often works by connecting new information to familiar concepts. Political campaigns frame their candidates using metaphors—as fighters, healers, or outsiders—to tap into existing narratives people understand.\n",
    "The power of framing lies in its subtlety. We often don't notice we're being presented with one interpretation among many possible ones. Recognizing frames—both in others' communication and our own—helps us think more critically and communicate more intentionally. It's not necessarily about manipulation; even neutral, well-intentioned communication involves framing choices that affect understanding.Claude is AI and can make mistakes. Please double-check responses. Sonnet 4.5\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt 2: \"Please explain the concept of framing in communication.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response:**\n",
    "Framing in communication is the way we structure and present information to shape how others perceive and interpret it. It's the lens through which we ask people to view a situation, and it can dramatically influence understanding, emotions, and decisions—even when the underlying facts remain the same.\n",
    "At its core, framing recognizes that there's rarely just one \"neutral\" way to communicate something. Every choice we make about what to include, what to emphasize, how to say it, and what comparisons to draw creates a frame that guides interpretation.\n",
    "Consider a classic example: a medical procedure with a 90% survival rate versus one with a 10% mortality rate. These statements are factually identical, but the first frame (survival) tends to make people more willing to proceed, while the second (mortality) increases anxiety and hesitation. The frame affects decision-making even though the risk is unchanged.\n",
    "Framing operates through several mechanisms. We select certain details while omitting others, creating a partial picture that feels complete. We choose metaphors and analogies that connect new information to familiar concepts—describing an argument as a \"battle\" suggests winners and losers, while calling it a \"dance\" implies coordination and mutual movement. We also use language with specific emotional associations: \"freedom fighter\" versus \"terrorist,\" \"undocumented immigrant\" versus \"illegal alien.\" In everyday life, you see framing constantly. A company announces it's \"rightsizing\" rather than conducting layoffs. A politician frames a policy as protecting freedom or ensuring fairness. Parents frame vegetables as making you strong rather than just being healthy.\n",
    "Understanding framing helps you become both a more critical consumer of information and a more effective communicator, recognizing that how we say something is inseparable from what we're actually communicating.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt 3: \"Explain the concept of framing in communication now.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response:**\n",
    "Framing in communication is how we present information in ways that influence how people understand and react to it. It's the perspective or angle we choose when conveying a message, and it shapes meaning even when the facts stay the same.\n",
    "Think of it this way: imagine looking at a building through different windows. Each window shows you the same building, but what you see depends on where you're standing. Framing works similarly—it determines what's visible, what's emphasized, and what remains in the background.\n",
    "A simple example: saying a glass is \"half full\" versus \"half empty.\" Same amount of water, completely different implications about optimism, scarcity, or satisfaction. That's framing at work.\n",
    "Framing happens through the words we choose, the comparisons we make, and what details we include or leave out. A protest can be framed as \"civil unrest\" or \"citizens exercising their rights.\" A tax can be framed as \"your contribution to schools and roads\" or \"government taking your hard-earned money.\" The facts might be identical, but each frame activates different values, emotions, and conclusions.\n",
    "What makes framing powerful is that it often works invisibly. We absorb the frame without realizing we're seeing one interpretation among many. Politicians, marketers, journalists, and anyone trying to persuade or inform uses framing constantly.\n",
    "Being aware of framing helps you recognize when you're being guided toward a particular interpretation, and it makes you more deliberate in your own communication. You start asking: what's being highlighted here? What's being left out? What assumptions does this frame rely on?\n"

    "## Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "To test my questions, I used three prompts that showed subtle degrees of varying in politeness. I kept these prompts for the most part very short with a slight tweak to demonstrate a change in tone; however, the LLM responded almost identically to all three prompts regardless of the tone the question was asked in. These leads me to believe that LLMs focus almost entirely on the question / task being asked and do not take into account the tone they reply in, unless explicitly asked. However, I do think that if the situation was more emotionally charged, this might inspire the LLM to respond with a different tone, opposed to a tone difference between using please or asking more abruptly."
