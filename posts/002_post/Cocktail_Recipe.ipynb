    "I am hosting a dinner party tonight for around 20 people. It is a calm dinner with friends of mine and I want to think of a good cocktail that is universal enough to serve for a large group of people that most likely everyone will enjoy - not overwhelmingly sweet or bitter, but a classic cocktail. I do not want a standard cocktail like a margarita but something unique. Can you help me come up with something?"
