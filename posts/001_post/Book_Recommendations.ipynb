The first one suggested is the only one I have read and it is by my second favorite author, which makes me very hopeful about the rest of the suggestions. What I am going to do next is read these books and then give Chat GPT my reviews and specific thoughts to see how that will fine tune their suggestions and recommendations for me. "
