    "**Description:** This post reflects on Bennett’s argument that intelligence requires goals and agency, and why AI systems fundamentally differ from biological minds in this respect.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the book moves toward comparing biological intelligence with artificial systems, Bennett places increasing emphasis on the role of goals in shaping intelligent behavior. In living organisms, intelligence is oriented toward survival, reproduction, and adaptation. These goals are not optional — they are built into the structure of biological life. Intelligence, in this sense, exists for something.\n",
    "\n",
    "What stood out to me is Bennett’s argument that AI systems do not possess goals in the same way. Large language models generate outputs based on optimization objectives defined by humans, but they do not pursue goals autonomously or revise them based on lived outcomes. This difference helps explain why AI can appear purposeful while remaining fundamentally passive.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section reframed how I think about agency in AI. While LLMs can simulate decision-making, they do not care whether those decisions succeed or fail. Without intrinsic goals or stakes, intelligence becomes detached from consequence. Bennett’s discussion made it clear that this gap is not a technical oversight, but a defining feature of how AI systems are designed."
