    "\n",
    "This post tests whether an LLM can recognize audience differences and adapt its communication style accordingly, a core concept in communication studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In human communication, effective messaging depends on:\n",
    "\n",
    "Who the audience is\n",
    "\n",
    "What prior knowledge they have\n",
    "\n",
    "What tone and level of detail is appropriate\n",
    "\n",
    "This blog evaluates whether LLMs can perform this same kind of audience-aware framing, or whether they simply simplify language without truly adapting meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**\n",
    "The task in this experiment is to ask the LLM to explain the same concept to three different audiences: a middle school student, a college professor, and a business executive. By holding the topic constant and changing only the audience, this test isolates whether the model can meaningfully adjust its communication style."

    "At its core, modern AI—particularly machine learning—works by:\n",
    "\n",
    "Representing data numerically (features or embeddings)\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying algorithms that optimize a model’s parameters to minimize error\n",
    "\n",
    "Generalizing learned patterns to unseen data\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning uses labeled datasets to learn mappings from inputs to outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks learn hierarchical representations through weighted layers and backpropagation\n",
    "\n",
    "Large language models estimate probability distributions over sequences of tokens based on massive corpora\n",
    "\n",
    "AI systems do not possess understanding or intentionality; they perform statistical inference at scale, constrained by data quality, model architecture, and objective functions.\n",

    "3. For a business executive\n",

    "Artificial intelligence is a technology that turns data into predictions, recommendations, or automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "AI systems analyze large volumes of historical data\n",
    "\n",
    "They identify patterns humans can’t easily detect\n",
    "\n",
    "They apply those patterns to make faster, more consistent decisions\n",

    "Scalability\n",

    "Altough the LLM definitely did create different leveled responses for each age group, it was interesting that the length and structure of response remained the same. All three were bullet pointed and in short succinct sentences to describe the topic in just as much depth, but in different terms. I have noticed this is GPT's \"go to\" approach when responding to different questions and requests, usually responding with a brief overview and subsequent bullet points outlining the answer."
