    "**Description:** This post reflects on Bennett’s emphasis on embodiment and experience as central components of biological intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the middle of the book, Bennett turns to the role of experience in shaping intelligence, arguing that cognition evolved in constant interaction with the physical world. Brains developed in bodies that moved, sensed danger, failed, and adapted over time. Intelligence, in this sense, is inseparable from feedback, consequence, and lived experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section clarified for me why AI systems, despite their fluency, think so differently from humans. Large language models do not learn through experience or interaction with the world. They do not receive consequences for mistakes in the way living organisms do. Instead, they learn by identifying patterns in existing data, which fundamentally shapes what they can and cannot understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I took away from this part of the book is not that AI is deficient, but that it is structurally different. Without embodiment or evolutionary pressure, AI’s “knowledge” remains detached from the environments that give human intelligence its depth. This helped me better understand why AI can sound insightful while still missing situational or contextual meaning."
