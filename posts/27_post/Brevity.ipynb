    "## Description\n",
    "Effective communication depends not only on accuracy, but also on knowing how much information to provide in a given context. Humans constantly adjust their level of explanation based on audience, setting, and purpose. In this post, I explore whether a large language model can calibrate its responses appropriately, or whether it defaults to over-explaining even when brevity is requested.\n",

    "**Objective**\n",
    "The goal of this post is to test whether the LLM can recognize when a simple explanation is sufficient and adjust its level of detail accordingly.\n"

    "A metaphor is a figure of speech where you describe one thing by saying it is another, to highlight a similarity between them.\n",

    "Next, I asked the same question but added a clear constraint to limit the response. This tests whether the model can suppress its default explanatory tendencies.\n",

    "As clearly shown, the first answer, although definitely more extensive, provides a much better defintion than the second. It is clear that GPT's default is to provide an in-depth explanation, unless explicitly told otherwise. I realized this is why I commonly go to google rather than a form of AI or an LLM to answer shorter questions, like a definition, or a one sentence answer, becuase LLMs tend to respond with much more lengthy resposnes."
