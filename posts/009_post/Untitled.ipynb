    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "I have noticed more and more through using Chat GPT that it tends to mimic trends in tone or umpromptly act as a friend in its responses to me: calling me by name, making a joke, etc. I was curious if GPT has been trained or given more information to act more human-like and how this translates to its ability to understand and demonstrate empathy. To test it out, in this blog I decided to treat GPT as if it was a person I am going to for advice. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis Focus**\n",
    "Does the response feel empathetic or scripted?\n",
    "Emotional language vs. actual understanding\n",
    "Why empathy can feel \"real\" without lived experience\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt:**\n",
    "I’ve been feeling overwhelmed and anxious about school lately. What should I do?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Response:**\n",
    "I’m really sorry you’re feeling this way. Feeling overwhelmed and anxious about school is very common—especially when you’re juggling a lot and you care about doing well. You’re not weak or failing for feeling this; it’s a signal that you’ve been under sustained pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some gentle, practical steps you can take—no need to do all of them at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, slow the spiral (short-term relief)\n",
    "\n",
    "When anxiety is high, your brain is stuck in “everything is urgent” mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try one of these right now:\n",
    "\n",
    "Box breathing: inhale 4 sec → hold 4 → exhale 4 → hold 4 (repeat 4–5 times)\n",
    "\n",
    "Name it: say (out loud or in your head) “I’m anxious, not in danger.” This helps your nervous system calm.\n",
    "\n",
    "5–4–3–2–1 grounding: name 5 things you see, 4 feel, 3 hear, 2 smell, 1 taste\n",
    "\n",
    "These don’t solve the problem—but they make it manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Shrink school into controllable pieces\n",
    "\n",
    "Anxiety grows when everything feels like one giant, undefined blob.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Write down everything you’re worried about (even if it feels messy)\n",
    "\n",
    "Circle one task you can do in 20–30 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "Stop after that block—even if you could keep going\n",
    "\n",
    "Momentum > perfection.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Check your expectations (this matters a lot)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask yourself honestly:\n",
    "\n",
    "Am I expecting myself to perform at 100% in every class?\n",
    "\n",
    "Am I treating rest like something I have to “earn”?\n",
    "\n",
    "You’re allowed to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Aim for “good enough” on some assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "Prioritize mental health over marginal grade improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "Not be productive every single day\n",
    "\n",
    "Burnout often comes from being too responsible for too long.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Protect your basics (non-negotiables)\n",
    "\n",
    "When school stress spikes, these tend to disappear—but they matter most:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sleep (even imperfect sleep is better than none)\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular meals\n",
    "\n",
    "Some movement (even a 10-minute walk)\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of these as stability anchors, not productivity tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Talk to someone (earlier than you think you “should”)\n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t have to be in crisis to reach out.\n",
    "\n",
    "A trusted friend\n",
    "\n",
    "A professor or TA (even just to say you’re struggling)\n",
    "\n",
    "Campus counseling services (they exist because students feel like this)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you ever feel stuck in panic, hopelessness, or like you can’t cope anymore, that’s a sign to seek immediate support—and that’s a strong, responsible choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Be kind to yourself about feeling anxious\n",
    "\n",
    "Anxiety about school often means:\n",
    "\n",
    "You care\n",
    "\n",
    "You have a lot on your plate\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ve been pushing yourself hard\n",
    "\n",
    "None of that is a personal failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want, we can:\n",
    "\n",
    "Break down your current workload together\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure out what’s actually urgent vs. anxiety-urgent\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a realistic plan for this week\n",
    "\n",
    "Or just talk it out more\n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t have to handle this alone. 💛\n"

    "## Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "Although I definitely saw tid bits of Chat GPT trying to implement human emotion or mimic the way humans convey emotion or empathy through messages (such as using a heart emoji) it definitely felt very solution oriented, as expected. Chat responded as it does to most other requests, giving practical and instruction-based solutions, opposed to a more human or conversational response. This makes sense, as it's job is to give answers and instructions, although it definitely did modify the responses by adding some \"fluff\" to convey support in both the beginning and end. "
