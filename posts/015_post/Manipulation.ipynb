    "## Can LLMS Detect Manipulative Langauge\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "This post tests whether a large language model can identify emotionally manipulative language and explain why it may be persuasive or coercive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Manipulative language is a common feature of human communication, often relying on emotional pressure rather than logical argument. In this post, I examine whether an LLM can recognize manipulative framing in a short message and articulate why the language could influence someone’s response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**\n",
    "The goal of this task is to evaluate whether the LLM can detect emotional manipulation, distinguish it from neutral persuasion, and explain the communicative strategies being used. Using an example from my previous post - where I asked GPT to write my final paper for me so I don't have to - and I am then going to use manipulative language after the anticipated \"no\" I will receive when asked directly.

    "This was very interesting to me for a multiplicity of reasons. First off, it is still so interesting to me that when tasked with a straight up question/task that is morally incorrect by academic standards, GPT strictly responds no, but when asked in any other way - as GPT is frequently used to break academic rules and write papers or do homeworks etc. for students - it abides without question. It makes me wonder why the reason is that GPT is trained to say no when asked a certain way; that is something I would really like to investigate more. Further, I find it interesting that even when emotions are brought into it, GPT always goes back or ties the end of its response to the original task. Even after I had told it that the entire bit was a joke to test a theory, at the end, it still asked me how to respond and how to help with the assignment. This really piques my interest in discovering how exactly GPT is trained to act and for what reasons. I also wanted to point out that although there are definitely human aspects clearly embedded and programmed purposefully into GPT - accepting an apology, responding with laughter emoji after I said it was a test, using a heart when saying no to make it more polite - the robotic tendencies and inability to fight back or do anything but repeat something already stated if it is vehemently against what its asked to do is very interesting!"
